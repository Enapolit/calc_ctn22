		<p>When Carmen Hurd gave birth to her son last year, she knew caring for him would be a lot of work, but she never imagined it would become her full-time job.</p>
		<p>But when Hurd, a former farm manager from Fort Wayne, Indiana, discovered that infant care programs in her area charged more than $1,000 a month, she knew quitting her job to look after her son made a lot of financial sense.</p>
		<p>“Daycare wasn’t an option, so I was a stay-at-home mom right from the start,” said Hurd.</p>
		<p>Hurd is one of 110 million US adults struggling to access child care, an essential — and in many developed nations, heavily-subsidized — service that has long been too scarce or too pricey for the majority of US families. And since the pandemic, that problem has only gotten worse.</p>
		<p>During the pandemic, many day care centers struggled to compensate their employees as they contended with forced closures, enrollment fluctuations and social distancing regulations that limited capacity and revenue. About 12% of US child care centers closed permanently during the first year of the pandemic, according to a report from Child Care Aware. And while generous pandemic-era grants helped resuscitate child care after the pandemic nearly decimated the industry last year, advocates say lawmakers must sustain that level of funding to protect an already vulnerable system from teetering over the brink of collapse.</p>
		<p>Cindy Lehnhoff, director of the National Child Care Association says an investment in the child care industry is also a critical investment in the US economy. Before the pandemic, the US economy lost $57 billion annually due to child care shortages.</p>
		<p>“Lawmakers are investing a lot of money in what I call ‘concrete’ bills — funding infrastructure like roads and bridges — but we tell them that’s not going to do much if you don’t have a bill that invests in the foundation of society, which is human infrastructure,” said Lehnhoff. “Without that investment in human infrastructure, you won’t have the people to build the roads or the bridges.”</p>
		<p>Child care centers are still contending with pandemic-driven setbacks like rising supply costs, wages and enrollment fluctuations, which have cripled the already vulnerable industry.</p>
		<p>Daycare enrollment was down 67% nationwide as of July 2021, according to a survey by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC).</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, 70% of child care centers report they’ve incurred higher staffing, cleaning supply and PPE costs as COVID-era restrictions force centers to follow more stringent cleaning protocols and maintain lower staff-to-child ratios.</p>
		<p>.Nearly 16,000 daycares and licensed family child care programs shutdown permanently between December 2019 and March 2021, according to a new report from Child Care Aware of America.</p>
		<p>But pandemic-era setbacks are just the latest blow to an industry that found itself in a precarious position well before the pandemic.</p>
		<p>Since the late 1980s, child care grants have comprised a very small slice of the federal budget. Before the pandemic, states usually received between $3 and $5 billion dollars toward early childhood subsidy programs and financial support programs for daycares, Lehnhoff says. That’s just between 7 and 12 percent of the $42 billion dollars American families spent on early childhood education and infant care programs in 2021.</p>
		<p>Over the years, advocates have tried and failed to convince lawmakers to funnel more money into early childhood programs. But it wasn’t until the pandemic hit that lawmakers had enough political will to act.</p>
		<p>In March 2021, lawmakers passed the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 Stimulus package that included $39 billion in emergency funding to stabilize the child care sector.</p>
		<p>The act provided daycares with aid to increase sanitation measures and boost workers’ wages, but it didn’t help more families qualify for aid or eliminate many of the barriers to applying for aid.</p>
		<p>Another broad COVID-recovery package seemed poised to address some of those issues, however.</p>
			<p>In November 2021, the Biden administration introduced the Build Back Better Act, a multi-trillion-dollar spending package which included a bill that would pump $382 billion into childcare for children 0 to 5 funded by taxes on corporations and the ultra wealthy.</p>
			<p>The bill would subsidize child care costs for nine in 10 families —only one in six families that need subsidies qualifies under the current eligibility guidelines — and families earning up to 2.5 times their state’s median income would qualify for aid. Child care co-pays for families receiving government assistance would be capped at 7 percent of a family’s earnings.</p>
			<p>But the bill never passed. Senate Republicans blocked the BBB Act for fear it would contribute to the national debt and runaway inflation.</p>
			<p>“‘Build Back Broke’ bill is what I call it,” said Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi, after the bill was passed by the House, which Democrats control by a razor-thin margin.</p>
			<p>Some Republicans are still unconvinced that any type of child care bill is necessary at all.</p>
			<p>"I don't think it should be controversial to say that parents should have the primary responsibility for taking care of their children," Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin told a local television station in January. "I don't think it should be controversial to be concerned about being $29 trillion in debt, and additional deficit spending that would be sparked by even more federal government programs that we can't afford.</p>
			<p>But despite some dissenting Republican voices, the child care safety net is generally an issue of bipartisan agreement. Republicans even introduced their own bill to address the issue this year, following the BBB’s death on the Senate floor.</p>
			<p>The Republicans’ bill would funnel more money into the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG), a federal program that funds child care, to increase the money sent to states to help low-income families pay for care. The amount of money that would be sent to states under the bill remains unclear, however.</p>
			<p>The plan, like the Democrats’ plan, also includes a provision that expands child care, with families earning up to 1.5 times the state median income, or about $142,000 the national income, having their co-pays capped at 7 percent of their total earnings. In addition, families earning up to 75 percent of the median state income, or about 71,000, on average, would pay nothing for child care.</p>
			<p>So far, neither the Republicans’ bill, nor the Democrats’ bill has been signed into law. That is because lawmakers continue to negotiate key points of contention, like improving wages for child care workers.</p>

		<p>State Measures</p>
		<p>As congressional gridlocks continue to block federal aid and stymie the creation of a child care safety net, some states have stepped up to fill in the gaps.</p>
		<p>Last Tuesday, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York announced her state would begin distributing $2 billion in child care subsidies, the largest investment in child care in the state’s history. The investment is part of a larger $7 billion investment in child care over the next four years across the Empire state that will also help the state create more child care centers.</p>
		<p>But Gov. Hochul’s pledge to ramp up aid for New York daycares, workers and families across the state, isn’t the first or only state plan to try to make advances toward universal child care.</p>
		<p>On May 1, New Mexico passed a bill that would funnel ARPA aid into grants that would provide copayment-free child care to families earning up to 400% of the state’s median income.  Previously, only families at 200% FPL or below qualified for waived copayments. The program, which would grant a year of free childcare to 30,000 additional families before federal pandemic funding dries up in 2023, is an early experiment in universal child care.</p>
		<p>“It’s free, no more co-pays, no more waiting,” New Mexico Gov. Lujan Grisham said to an audience of preschoolers at East Gate Kids Learning Center in Albuquerque after the bill was passed. “This is the road to a universal child-care system.”</p>
		<p>Grant Blitzke, a community coordinator at Family Help Network in Fort Wayne, Indiana, who works to connect qualifying families with high-quality child care centers that accept childcare vouchers, estimates more than fifty percent of families who call him for assistance are ineligible for child care subsidies by a small margin.</p>
		<p>“Oftentimes we receive calls from families looking for access to subsidies or vouchers  who are making just over the maximum income [to receive child care subsidies],” said Blitzke. “If they were to pay for child care out of pocket, it would almost not be worth it for them to work. I think even people that are considered well off still find that childcare is expensive for them, in a lot of cases.”</p>
		<p>But while New Mexico’s ambitious bill could serve as a lodestone for other states, and perhaps even the federal government; it's unclear when the program will begin and whether the state has the infrastructure and administrative capabilities to pull it off.</p>
		<p>Elizabeth Arnold, a farm owner and freelance graphic designer who lives in a rural suburb of Albuquerque, New Mexico, says her two experiences applying for child care through New Mexico’s Early Childhood Education and Care Department (ECECD) over the past three years were nightmares.</p>
		<p>Arnold first began researching infant care programs just a few days after her daughter’s first birthday. Before that, she would strap her daughter to her back so she could complete chores around the farm. But both Arnold and her daughter grew tired of multitasking.</p>
		<p>“If I have to carry her then it's hard for me to lift things, and there was a limit to how much she would tolerate.”</p>
		<p>Arnold began to research infant care programs in her community and drove to the ECECD office to apply for childcare assistance.</p>
		<p>When she arrived at the office, baby in her arms, there was nobody there to greet her. Arnold seated herself and waited for over three hours to be seen by a caseworker.</p>
		<p>“I was sitting there breastfeeding in this tiny little room full of broken dirty toys just waiting and waiting to meet with someone,” said Arnold.</p>
		<p>Arnold, who went through the application process twice — once before the pandemic, and once during the pandemic — after he daughter switched daycares, said that both application periods took a few months. The process took so long that Arnold had to borrow money from her mother to send her daughter to a high-quality school an hour away from her hometown.</p>
		<p>High-quality child care centers that are accredited by national organizations are not common in Arnold’s rural community, where home-based providers are far more common. Across the US, 51% of families live in child care deserts, where access to quality care is hard to come by.</p>
		<p>Melissa Scott, the director of Pando Little School in Albuquerque, New Mexico, says daycare spots have been extremely limited since the pandemic began. At one point during the pandemic, Pando Little School had as many as 500 families on its waiting list.</p>
		<p>Due to the fact that the competition for available spots is so high, and due to the fact that  government “contract” daycare spots cost less than spots that are paid for by families out of pocket, many spots go to those who can pay the center upfront, leaving families that qualify for government assistance unable to use the aid they receive.</p>
		<p>Scott says she would like to charge parents the difference between the government contract price and the full-tuition price, but to do so would be illegal.</p>
		<p>“I have the really uncomfortable decision of telling [families] they can go somewhere if they want to use the contract, knowing that no one else has a spot for them, or they can pay full tuition,” said Scott. “I want families to get whatever financial break they can, but I also still need to be able to afford to run things.”</p>
		<p>With rising wages in other service industries convincing more and more daycare workers to leave the field, spots for children all across the country could become ever fewer. Among child care centers that have remained open during the pandemic, 81 percent enroll fewer kids today than they did pre-pandemic.</p>
		<p>Scott says she hasn’t struggled with retention as much as other centers because she’s constantly working on boosting morale, but she admits she struggles to pay her workers what they deserve, even after using some of the COVID grants she received toward boosting her teachers’ pay.</p>
		<p>“I have teachers with multiple master’s degrees and I would love to pay them more, but I just can’t pay them as much as other businesses would,” said Scott “But, of course, I would love to pay them what they’re worth.”</p>

        <p>Prices for residential photovoltaic (PV) systems have risen nearly 50% over the past year as the prices of component materials like polysilicon, steel, glass and copper continue to rise. </p>

        <p> The situation could be a knife-edge for the thriving residential solar industry that has emerged along America’s sunbelt. That is because the long-term cost benefit of solar energy for consumers is what entices many homeowners to make the switch to solar. 
</p>

        <p>But now, with prices rising and the end of government subsidies for home PV systems on the horizon, consumer interest in solar energy could wane.

       <p>Here are the materials that are causing PV system prices to hit new highs: </p>

	 <p>California, which also struggles with child care deserts and teacher retention issues that have been exacerbated by the pandemic, is addressing a lack of daycare spots by funneling money directly into funding salary increases and training sessions for daycare teachers.</p>
	    <p>In July 2021, Gov. Newsom of California, signed the child care budget trailer bill, which will allocate $40 million to address workforce needs including education, training and professional development for family child care providers.. The bill is expected to create 200,000 new child care slots by 2025-26, with over 145,000 new child care slots expected to be added by 2022-23.</p>
	     <p>The bill also includes $579 million for additional support to child care and preschool providers, including stabilization stipends, to ensure more centers can continue operating in the wake of pandemic-specific challenges. Like in New Mexico, family copays will be waived for one year. </p>
	     <p>Although California and New Mexico’s approaches to improving child care differ, both states are among just a handful of places in the US that have taken the initiative to fund child care at the state level. And childcare workers in other states have taken notice.</p>
	     <p>Melissa Newsom, a daycare worker in West Virginia, the fourth poorest state in America, says many of her friends who work in child care have left West Virginia for states like California, where state funding makes teachers feel “more valued.”</p>
	     <p>“All the good sensible people leave ASAP to find work outside the state because the pay here is awful and the resources are scarce.”</p>
